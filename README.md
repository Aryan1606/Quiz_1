# Quiz_1

This is a very basic Online quiz dynamic website for "Teacher" and "Students" to take "Create test" and "Take Test" It has two options: "Sign Up" and "Login" Clicking "Sign Up" and registring yourself with the required details you will automatically be redirected to your profile page where your details will be visible and depending on whether you are a "Teacher" or "Student" you will be able to "Create A Test" or "Take A Test" Once Signed Up ,you can directly login through your "UserName" and "Password" which you will set up in your "Sign-Up" page

There can be "Many Teacher" and "Many Students" but once any "Teacher" creates a "Test" all Students can give that Test If Another Teacher Creates Another Test, "Students" will only be able to give the "Older Test first then the latest one" i,e, Students will give test in order FIFO.
